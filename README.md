## Developer story

This is my first released game and it was created in 4 days during the [IGDB Beginner's Jam December 2023](https://itch.io/jam/igdb-beginners-jam-december-2023). 

I did everything all by myself: code, arts, sound design, etc.

The only existing asset I used is [the Bonk sound from this no-copyright source](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/bonk-sound-effect-36055/).

### Softwares I used to make this game

I used [Godot ❤️](https://godotengine.org/) (v4.2) to make this game and write the code.

Visual assets were made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [Laigter](https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter) was used to create normal and specular maps for my art.

Multiple softwares were used for the sound design :
* [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) for quickly creating interactive sounds (like when a character is hurt or when something appear on screen)
* [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/) for creating the music
* [AudioMass](https://audiomass.co/) to edit some soundtrack online

I used [Notion](https://notion.so) to write my ideas and do some little project management.

## Open Source License

This game is under the GNU GPLv3 License.

This is my first game and the source code is far from perfect but feel free to use this game to learn and improve with Godot (which is an amazing engine btw).
